# Url Checker
`main.py` contains the program, but `setup.py` is irrelevant, it contains the requirements, and my contact infos.

# How it works?
Type a url *(ex.: google.com)* press the `ELEMZÉS` button `-->` Url sent to VirusTotal API `-->` Test result gets sent back to the client.

# Known issues
⚠️ This is an issue with **VirusTotal**
`Issue: The result can be false positive, and vice-versa`
